# ProjectEulerSolutions
Solving the questions in Project Euler archives with the community help !

This is an attempt to solve as many questions as possible of the Project Euler archives with the help of all the good samaritans out there.
All the solutions are divided into three dificulty levels (dl) in the form of packages:

* Easy (dlEasy)
* Moderate (dlModerate)
* Difficult (dlDifficult)

For every solution add a new class in any package as you deem appropriate as per the difficulty level.

The naming convention followed for the class name is `"P(problem no)_(a meaningful name on the basis of the problem statement)"`.

Thanks for the help and Happy Coding!!
