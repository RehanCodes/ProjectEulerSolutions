Solving the questions in Project Euler archives with the community help !

This is an attempt to solve as many questions as possible of the Project Euler archives with the help of all the good samaritans out there.
For every solution add a new class in any package as you deem appropriate as per the difficulty level.

The naming convention followed for the class name is `"P(problem no)_(a meaningful name on the basis of the problem statement)"`.

For each class calculate and print the execution time also as a good practice. This can be done by using the below lines of code:
>long start=System.currentTimeMillis(); `at the beginning of the class`
>
>[
>
>Rest of the solution

>
> `towards the end of the class`
>
>long end=System.currentTimeMillis();
>
>long elapsedTime = end - start;
>
>System.out.println("\nTime taken for the execution : "+elapsedTime+" ms");


###### Any other way for calculating the execution time is also fine.

Thanks for the help and Happy Coding!!
